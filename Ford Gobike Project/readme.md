# Usage and user analysis of Ford GoBike system
## by Xiangning Bu

## Dataset

> The current dataset collected all usage data of Ford GoBike during February of 2019, which contains 183412 trips and 15 variables including trip time, user_type, genders and so on.  My goal is to find out which features contribute to the usage of Ford gobike bikes, by exploring the relationship between duration time with several factors, such as gender, user_type and day of week.

## Summary of Findings

>1. Trip time frequency and user population analysis:
I plot the trip time distribution with and without outliers. In both datasets, I found that most of the trip-times were between 100 to 1500 sec. In addition, there were much more subscribers than random customers, more male than female’ users, and more usage from Sunday to Thursday.

>2. From all 330 stations, I listed and mapped the top 10 start and end stations.

>3. By comparation of average trip time between user_types and genders, I found that the average trip time of customers is much longer than that of subscribers, even after breaking down by gender and day of week.  

>4. Firstly, it seems the average times are shorter in males and day with more bike usage frequency.  However, after removing the outliers, the average trip time is similar among genders and day of week. 
>5. In both customers and subscribers, there are much more males (> two folds) than females. 

## Key Insights for Presentation
Most of the trip-times were between 100 to 1500 sec. In addition, there were much more subscribers than random customers, more male than female’ users, and more usage from Sunday to Thursday. I listed and mapped the top 10 start and end stations in bay area.
By comparation of average trip time between user_types and genders, I found that the average trip time of customers is much longer than that of subscribers, even after breaking down by gender and day of week.  However, the average trip time is similar among genders and day of week.
