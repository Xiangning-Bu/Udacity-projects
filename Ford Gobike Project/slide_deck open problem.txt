Hi Kirill,

I ran into the same issue.

I found the following and it worked for me, after making sure the latest version of nbconvert is installed:

Hiding the input is now possible directly from nbconvert as of version 5.2.1: content can be filtered using the built-in template exporter exclude options. For example:


jupyter nbconvert --to slides --TemplateExporter.exclude_input=True my_notebook.ipynb



It looks as if output_toggle is no longer needed.
